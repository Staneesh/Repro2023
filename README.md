# Reproducing ARIMA Model Research

The scientific paper which results we chose to reproduce was _"Air Passengers Occupancy Prediction Using Arima Model"_ by Konda Himakireeti and Tammishetti Vishnu (2019). 

## Scientific Paper

The paper presents the process of tuning ARIMA model to predict air passengers occupancy over time. Code used to implement this statistical model was not attached to the paper, so we chose to re-implement relevant parts of the procedure described in detail in the scientific article.

## Our Workflow

Most important development tools used in the process are listed below:

* We used [Python](https://www.python.org/) as our language of choice.
* Analysis was performed in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). 

## Collaboration

In our work we relied heavily on Git:

* We used the [Issues](https://github.com/Staneesh/Repro2023/issues) tab to decide on a project topic and its scope.
* We used the `main` branch as the project master.
* The `main` branch was protected from direct pushes - approval from all team members was required for every pull request, which forced all team members to communicate and comment.
